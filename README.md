Experimentation project for a climbing trip planner app

## Research

Geolocation Services:

- [ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/): API is simple and well-documented, [pricing](https://developers.arcgis.com/pricing/) seems not too bad for now for experimenting.

Weather Services:

- [PirateWeather](https://pirateweather.net/en/latest/): based on government-provided weather sources, drop in replacement for Dark Sky, 15000 requests per month
- [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/): more commercial than the above
